Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] shards [shards-OPTIONS] prune [prune-OPTIONS]

Recovery logs capture every write which has ever occurred in a Shard DB.
This includes all prior writes of client keys & values, and also RocksDB
compactions, which can significantly inflate the total volume of writes
relative to the data currently represented in a RocksDB.

Prune log examines the provided hints to identify Fragments of the log
which have no intersection with any live files of the DB, and can thus
be safely deleted.
