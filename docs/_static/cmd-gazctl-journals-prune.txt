Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] journals [journals-OPTIONS] prune [prune-OPTIONS]

Deletes fragments across all configured fragment stores of matching journals that are older than the configured retention.

There is a caveat when pruning journals. Only fragments that are part of the "blessed" history are pruned in a given pass. Fragments associated to dead end forks will not be deleted. As a workaround, operators
can wait for the fragment listing to refresh and prune the journals again.

Use --selector to supply a LabelSelector to select journals to prune.
See "journals list --help" for details and examples.
