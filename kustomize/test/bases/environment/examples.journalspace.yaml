# Replication is the number of brokers required to participate in write
# transactions of the journal. I.e. a value of 3 means an Append RPC will proceed
# only after data has been replicated to three distinct brokers in at least two
# failure zones.

# Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to journals. They're intended

# Fragment defines how the broker will map accepted writes into fragments.
fragment:
  # Desired length of each journal fragment. Note fragments can be
  # substantially smaller or slightly larger under normal operation, as
  # journal assignments change or to ensure atomicity of writes.
  length: 268435456 # 256MB.
  # Stores enumerates the fragment backing stores of the journal. More
  # than one store may be provided. New fragments are always persisted
  # to the first store in the list, but all stores are refreshed when
  # building the fragment index.
  stores:
    - s3://examples/fragments/?profile=minio&endpoint=http%3A%2F%2Fminio%3A9000
  # Refresh interval defines the frequency with which stores are re-listed.
  refresh_interval: 1m0s
  # Retention is the time interval after which the fragment is eligible
  # for pruning from the backing store.
  retention: 720h0m0s
  # Compression codec used to compress fragments. One of:
  # NONE, GZIP, GZIP_OFFLOAD_DECOMPRESSION, SNAPPY, ZSTANDARD.

  # Flush interval defines the minimum frequency at which fragments are flushed.
