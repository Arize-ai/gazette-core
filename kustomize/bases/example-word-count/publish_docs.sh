It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
—Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859)

If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably
want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like,
and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that
David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it,
if you want to know the truth.
—J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye (1951)

I was born in the Year 1632, in the City of York, of a good Family,
tho' not of that Country, my Father being a Foreigner of Bremen, who
settled first at Hull; He got a good Estate by Merchandise, and leaving
off his Trade, lived afterward at York, from whence he had married my
Mother, whose Relations were named Robinson, a very good Family in that
Country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual
Corruption of Words in England, we are now called, nay we call our selves,
and write our Name Crusoe, and so my Companions always call'd me.
 —Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe (1719)
